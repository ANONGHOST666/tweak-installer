UI Source Code here : https://github.com/josephwalden13/Tweak-Installer-GUI

A tweak installer for Elecra and other jailbreaks which support sftp. Runs on windows currently but I'm planning on porting it to other OS's including maybe an on device app. 
Usage: 
  tic.exe [install] [uninstall] [manual] "optional path to deb file"

Tweak Installer.exe is bundled with all releases so that can be used instead of the command line for easier usage
