macOS port thanks to [/u/syto203](https://www.reddit.com/user/syto203)

A tweak installer for Elecra and other jailbreaks which support sftp. Runs on windows currently but I'm planning on porting it to other OS's including maybe an on device app. 
Usage: 
  tic.exe [install] [uninstall] [manual] "optional path to deb file"

Tweak Installer.exe is bundled with all releases so that can be used instead of the command line for easier usage
